# Summary
Biomechanics is at the interface of several fields of science, such as mechanics, human physiology and robotics.
Although this transdisciplinarity encourages the emergence of new ideas, the variety of data to analyze simultaneously can be overwhelming.
Commonly biomechanical datasets are composed of skin markers trajectories (termed as markers), contact forces, electromyography (EMG) signal, inertial measurement units (IMU) kinematics, etc., which by nature are not straightforward to combine.
It is at their meeting point---the body movement---that `biorbd` steps in; `bio` standing for biomechanics and `rbd` for `rigid body dynamics`.
`biorbd` is a *feature-based development* library that targets the manipulation of biomechanical data in a comprehensive and accessible manner.
For a given musculoskeletal model, it provides functions for inverse flow---i.e., from markers to EMG---and direct flow---i.e., from EMG to markers.

Since biomechanics often requires computationally expensive or real-time computations,
the core of `biorbd` is written in C++.
Although this language provides fast computations, it lacks the flexibility of higher-level languages.
To meet the needs of the biomechanics community, Python and MATLAB binders are provided with `biorbd`.
As a result, `biorbd` can elegantly be implemented to common workflows of researchers without compromising the required speed.

Finally, biomechanical data are often multidimensional and almost always time-dependent which can be challenging to visualize.
To help with that, `bioviz` [@Michaud2018bioviz], a Python visualizer, was purposely designed.
This visualizer allows animating the model, record videos, and, for models that include muscles, plot muscular outputs against various features of the movement.

# A `biorbd` overview, the inverse and direct flow
Biomechanical analyses are usually based on one (or a mixture) of the inverse or direct flow [@kainzJointKinematicCalculation2016].
Briefly, the former uses measurements from a movement (e.g., markers) and infers its cause, while the latter assumes control (e.g., EMG) and outputs the resulting kinematics.

## Inverse flow
*Inverse kinematics*: Estimates the generalized coordinates ($q$)—i.e., the body kinematics—from body sensor measurements (e.g., markers, IMU, etc.).
The main algorithm implemented is the Extended Kalman Filter [@fohannoEstimation3DKinematics2010a] which by design facilitates the merging of multiple data sources and takes care of missing data.

*Inverse dynamics*: Estimates the generalized forces ($\tau$) producing a given generalized acceleration ($\ddot{q}$) (the second time derivative of $q$):
$$
\tau = M(q)\ddot{q} + N(q, \dot{q})
$$
where $\dot{q}$ is the generalized velocities, $M(q)$ is the mass matrix and $N(q, \dot{q})$ are the nonlinear effects.

*Static optimization*: Estimates the muscle activations ($\alpha$) producing a given $\tau$ [@andersonStaticDynamicOptimization2001].
It minimizes the muscle activation *p*-norm ($p$ usually being $2$) that matches a given $\tau$ using nonlinear optimization [Ipopt, @wachterImplementationInteriorpointFilter2006].
$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \underset{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^m}{\text{minimize}}
    & & \left\lVert\alpha\right\rVert_p \\
    & \text{subject to}
    & & \tau_{mus_i}(\alpha ,q, \dot{q}) - \tau_{kin_i}(q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q}) = 0, &\; i=1,\ldots,n \\
    & & &  0 \leq \alpha_{t_j} \leq 1, &\; j=1,\ldots,m
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\tau_{mus_i}(\alpha ,q, \dot{q})$ and $\tau_{kin_i}(q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q})$ are $\tau$ computed from muscle forces ($F_{mus}(\alpha, q, \dot{q})$) and inverse dynamics, respectively.

## Direct flow
*Muscle activation dynamics*: Estimates the muscle activation derivative ($\dot{\alpha}$) from the muscle excitation---that is the calcium release in the muscle that triggers the muscle contraction.
Multiple activation/excitation dynamics are implemented [e.g., @manalOneparameterNeuralActivation2003;@thelenAdjustmentMuscleMechanics2003].

*Muscular joint torque*: Estimates the $\tau_{mus}$ from muscle forces ($F_{mus}(q, \dot{q}, \alpha)$) [@shermanHowComputeMuscle2010], estimated from $\alpha$ using a muscle model [e.g., @hillHeatShorteningDynamic1938; @thelenAdjustmentMuscleMechanics2003]:
$$
\tau_{mus} = J_{mus}(q)^T F_{mus}(q, \dot{q}, \alpha)
$$
where $J_{mus}(q)$ is the muscle lengths Jacobian.

*Forward dynamics*: Estimates the $\ddot{q}$ from a given $\tau$:
$$
\ddot{q} = M(q)^{-1}\tau - N(q, \dot{q})
$$
All the forward dynamics implemented in `RBDL` [@felisRBDLEfficientRigidbody2017] are available.

*Forward kinematics*: Estimates the model kinematics outputs (e.g., markers, IMU) from a given $q$, after integrating twice $\ddot{q}$.

# The dependencies
`biorbd` takes advantage of efficient back ends, especially  the `RBDL` and `CasADi` libraries.
`RBDL`, written by Martin Feliz [@felisRBDLEfficientRigidbody2017], implements Featherstone equations of spatial geometry [@featherstoneRobotDynamicsEquations2000], successfully used in the field of robotics [@macchiettoMomentumControlBalance2009; @diehlFastDirectMultiple2006; @kurfessRoboticsAutomationHandbook2018]. 
`RBDL` provides the computational core for body dynamics.
`biorbd` extends `RBDL` by giving commonly used biomechanics nomenclature, and by adding biomechanical modules, amongst others. 
`RBDL` is based on the highly efficient C++ linear algebra library `Eigen` [@guennebaud2010eigen].
Although `Eigen` is flexible and fast enough for most of the common usage, it cannot automatically provide derivatives of functions.
Therefore, `RBDL` was also augmented with the algorithmic differentiation library `CasADi` [@anderssonCasADiSoftwareFramework2019].
`CasADi` allows computing at low cost the derivatives of almost all the functions in `RBDL` and `biorbd`.
This is particularly useful when using `biorbd` in a gradient-based optimization setting.

# Statement of need
`OpenSim` [@sethOpenSimSimulatingMusculoskeletal2018] and `Anybody` [@damsgaardAnalysisMusculoskeletalSystems2006] are state-of-the-art biomechanics software that provides similar analysis flows with advanced user interface.
`Anybody` being a closed and proprietary software, the reason to create another library for the open-source community is self-explanatory.
Conversely, `OpenSim` is open-source and well established in the biomechanics community.

Nevertheless, in line with the idea that simulation software in biomechanics should be validated in multiple ways [@hicksMyModelGood2015], providing similar tools but different in their approach allows the community to cross-validate the different implementation of the algorithms.
For instance, two papers [@kimSimilaritiesDifferencesMusculoskeletal2018; @trinlerMuscleForceEstimation2019a] recently compared the outputs of `Anybody` and `OpenSim` and came to different results.
Although the authors provided plausible explanations for these differences, due to the closed-source nature of `Anybody`, they had to assume that the implementation of the algorithms are flawless in both software.
However, since a direct comparison between the actual codes is impossible, this is not verifiable.
Having multiple open source software that produces similar ends by different means is a quality assurance for the end users: "Do not put all your eggs in one basket.”
To the best of our knowledge, there is no other open-source software that provides a complete direct and inverse flow in biomechanics. 
Therefore, in our opinion, `biorbd` and `OpenSim` are complementary.

# Previous usage of `biorbd`
`biorbd` was used in most of the project of the *Laboratoire de Simulation et Modélisation du Mouvement* (S2M); particularly in analysis settings [@jacksonImprovementsMeasuringShoulder2012; @desmyttereEffect3DPrinted2020; @verdugoEffectsTrunkMotion2020] and simulation settings [@belaiseEMGmarkerTrackingOptimisation2018; @moissenetOptimizationMethodTracking2019] for a wide variety of movements (walking, piano playing, upper limb maximal exertions, etc.)
More recently, an optimal control framework for biomechanics [`bioptim`, @Michaud2018bioptim] based on Ipopt [@wachterImplementationInteriorpointFilter2006] and ACADOS [@Verschueren2019] was developed around `biorbd`.
